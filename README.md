Yahoo ticker downloader
==============================

A python3 script to scrape a lot (not all) ticker symbols from yahoo finance. It depends on the [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library.

It produces a .csv file for stocks, futures, ETF, indexes, mutual funds and currency. The ticker symbol, (company)name and exchange are saved. The category is stored too for stock symbols.

The program takes up a lot of RAM (up to 2GB) and serveral hours before it produces the .csv file. Sorry.

Its source is [http://finance.yahoo.com/lookup/](http://finance.yahoo.com/lookup/).
